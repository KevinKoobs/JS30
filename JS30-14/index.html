    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
	let age = 28,
		age2 = age;
	console.log(age, age2); // outputs 28 28
    age = 26;
    console.log(age, age2); // outputs 26 28

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
	console.log(team, players); // outputs the same arrays

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(players) // Outputs ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Lux']

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice(); // Copies original array
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
	const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    // Spread takes every item out of original array (or other iterable) and put it into containing array or function
    const team4 = [...players];

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team4[3] = 'Kevin';
    console.log(team4); // Will output Kevin in the team. Yeah :)

    const team5 = Array.from(players); // Also copies original array into new one
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person; // Makes a reference to the original person

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number : 99});

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread


    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
